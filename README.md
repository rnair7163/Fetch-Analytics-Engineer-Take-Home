## Task 1 - Review unstructured JSON data and diagram a new structured relational data model
Based on the data exploration performed, I created a relational data model with 4 datasets:-
- users
- receipts
- brands
- receipts_items_list

All the Data Exploration methodologies can be viewed in this [file](https://github.com/rnair7163/Fetch-Analytics-Engineer-Take-Home/blob/main/Data-Exploration_and_Cleaning.ipynb).
